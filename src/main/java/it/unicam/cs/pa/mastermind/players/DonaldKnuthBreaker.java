	/*
	 * Create the set S of 1296 possible codes (1111, 1112 ... 6665, 6666) Start
	 * with initial guess 1122 (Knuth gives examples showing that other first
	 * guesses such as 1123, 1234 do not win in five tries on every code) Play the
	 * guess to get a response of colored and white pegs. If the response is four
	 * colored pegs, the game is won, the algorithm terminates. Otherwise, remove
	 * from S any code that would not give the same response if it (the guess) were
	 * the code. Apply minimax technique to find a next guess as follows: For each
	 * possible guess, that is, any unused code of the 1296 not just those in S,
	 * calculate how many possibilities in S would be eliminated for each possible
	 * colored/white peg score. The score of a guess is the minimum number of
	 * possibilities it might eliminate from S. A single pass through S for each
	 * unused code of the 1296 will provide a hit count for each colored/white peg
	 * score found; the colored/white peg score with the highest hit count will
	 * eliminate the fewest possibilities; calculate the score of a guess by using
	 * "minimum eliminated" = "count of elements in S" - (minus)
	 * "highest hit count". From the set of guesses with the maximum score, select
	 * one as the next guess, choosing a member of S whenever possible. (Knuth
	 * follows the convention of choosing the guess with the least numeric value
	 * e.g. 2345 is lower than 3456. Knuth also gives an example showing that in
	 * some cases no member of S will be among the highest scoring guesses and thus
	 * the guess cannot win on the next turn, yet will be necessary to assure a win
	 * in five.) Repeat from step 3.
